# DBG Schedule Sync

![Icon](https://i.imgur.com/BvxYrRZt.png)

A web app to sync the representation plan of the school [DBG Metzingen](https://dbg-metzingen.de), which is hosted on
[DSBmobile](https://www.dsbmobile.de), to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com), build with
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

Only the changes which are relevant to the individual student get synced to their calendar. A separate secondary
calendar is created for the plan, which then looks something like in the image below.

The web app running in production can be found on [dbg-schedule-sync.web.app](https://dbg-schedule-sync.web.app).
